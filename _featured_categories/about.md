  Hi! I'm Paul Calvano.  I work as a Performance Architect at [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/), where I help optimize the performance of their online marketplace. I've actually been doing web performance work since 2000, which I guess makes me old :).  Previously, I worked at [Akamai Technologies](https://www.akamai.com/), and Keynote (which was later aquired by [Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com/)).
  
  I'm also a co-maintainer of the [HTTP Archive](https://httparchive.org), a really cool open source project that has been tracking the evolution of the web since 2010! I had the privilege of writing 2 chapters of the [2019 Web Almanac](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/) ([Caching](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/caching) and [Compression](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/compression)) as well as contributing to the 2020, 2021 and 2022 almanac!

  Additionally, I'm also a co-organizer of the [NY Web Performance Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/web-performance-ny/). If you are interested in giving a live or virtual talk at this event, please reach out. We also run monthly [Meet4Speed sessions](https://www.meetup.com/web-performance-ny/events/), where we take requests from the community for site's to analyze during a live session. These session are always a lot of fun, and anyone is welcome to join!    
  
  You can find me sharing web performance insights on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/paulcalvano), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulcalvano/), [Mastodon](https://webperf.social/@paulcalvano), as well as the HTTP Archive via their [blog](https://dev.to/httparchive) and [discussion forum](https://discuss.httparchive.org). I've also attempted to mirror all of my posts on this website so that they are easily searchable.
  
  When I'm not being [nerd sniped](https://xkcd.com/356/) with really interesting web performance problems, I'm usually having fun with my 4 awesome kids, cycling, baking and traveling.
