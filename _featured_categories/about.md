  Hi! I'm Paul Calvano.  I work as a Web Performance Architect at [Akamai Technologies](https://www.akamai.com/), where I help businesses improve the performance of their websites. I've actually been doing web performance work since 2000, which I guess makes me old :).
  
  I'm also a co-maintainer of the [HTTP Archive](https://httparchive.org), a really cool open source project that has been tracking the evolution of the web since 2010! I had a privalege of writing 2 chapters of the 2019 Web Almanac (Caching and Compression), and I'm currently leading a team of data analysts working on the 2020 Web Almanac!
  
  You can find me sharing web performance insights on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/paulcalvano) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulcalvano/), as well as the HTTP Archive via their [blog](https://dev.to/httparchive) and [discussion forum](https://discuss.httparchive.org). I've also attempted to mirror all of my posts on this website so that they are easily searchable.
  
  When I'm not being [nerd sniped](https://xkcd.com/356/) with really interesting web performance problems, I'm usually having fun with my 4 awesome kids, cycling, and baking.  I also love to travel, which such things are allowed...
