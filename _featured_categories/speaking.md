Here's a few of the talks that I've given over the past few years. I've included the slides for each presentation since I often update the stats before each event, and sometimes adjust tailor some stats to the locale I'm presenting in.

**Measuring the Adoption of Web Performance Techniques**

Performance optimization is a cyclical process. We are constantly learning new ways to optimize, while simultaneously adopting new technologies and techniques that negatively impact performance. The HTTP Archive provides a great historical record of the technical side of the web, with almost 10 years of history and an ever growing dataset of sites.

During this session I provided a brief overview of the HTTP Archive and then dove into some insights into the adoption of common web performance techniques and some of their measurable impacts.

**Common Traits of High Performing Websites**

Have you ever wondered how often some web performance best practices are implemented on the web? How much faster are sites that implement them, and what are some key things to avoid? During this session, well review data from the HTTP Archive, CrUX and mPulse to help answer some of these questions.

**Tracking the Performance of the Web With the HTTP Archive**

Have you ever thought about how your sites performance compares to the web as a whole? Or maybe youre curious how popular a particular web feature is. How much is too much JavaScript? The HTTP Archive has been keeping track of how the web is built since 2010. It enables you to find answers to questions about the state of the web past and present.

Paul Calvano explores how the HTTP Archive works, how people are using this dataset, and some ways that Akamai has leveraged data within the HTTP Archive to help its customers.

**Crushing it - Compression on the Web**

Less is more. Your customers want more information, more functionality and more engagement all in less time. Most websites use some sort of compression to help speed up their sites and reduce costs. With the average size of web pages growing over 3MB, gzip is no longer enough. In this session, the basics of modern compression are just the beginning, we will dig deeper into best practices and techniques that you can immediately apply to make the most out of an array of compression options, including multiple types of text compression, image and video compression, and even JavaScript compression.

How you configure compression matters to your customers experience and your bottom line. Dont just rely on a basic familiarity of compression. Maximize your compression knowledge and minimize your content volume.

**Real User Measurement Insights**

Many websites use real user measurement (RUM) data to analyze their performance, as well as to validate the impact of optimizations. During this session, well discuss how RUM is used and then explore some of the fascinating insights into the web that we can learn from it.

**Advanced Caching Concepts**

The caching ecosystem has evolved over the years  what, where, and how long you cache your web assets are now important considerations for anyone doing business on the internet. Browser cache, html5 application cache, sophisticated reverse proxies like Varnish, and the evolution of CDNs have all elevated caching as the single most effective tool for creating high performing and scalable web applications.

Using live demos, we will dive into some advance caching concepts that will enable you to squeeze the most benefits from this caching ecosystem.
